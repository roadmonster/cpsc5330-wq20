The education department maintains a large database of data about colleges and universities.
For this exercise we will use a small data set, in college_data_small.csv -- the data dictionary 
is in college_data_dictionary.txt

You will build a system that will culminate in a query asking for all colleges in a state, 
and provide a cost threshold, and the system will print all colleges in that state with 
cost below the threshold, ordered by cost. 

You will only store the following information about each college
-- state (this is your partition key)
-- cost (this is your sort key)
-- name
-- city
-- admission rate (multiply the value by 100 and store it as an integer)


1.  Create your DynamoDB table.  (Use state as the partition key and cost as the sort key.)
      You can store only admission rate in addition to state and cost
2.  Upload the data file to an S3 bucket
3.  Write Python code to read from the college data file and populate the DynamoDB table.
      PLEASE ONLY LOAD THE FIRST 3000 ITEMS TO SAVE MONEY.
	  
4.  Write a Python program that will prompt for a state name and a cost threshold,
    and will print a list of the colleges in that state under the threshold, in ascending
	order of cost.  (Hint:  since cost is your sort key, you get the costs in ascending order).
	For each college, print the name, state, city, cost, and admission rate.
	
For 1 additional point:
Notice the last three fields are "primary programs."  Mostly these are null.
Extend your program to add an array of programs to the DynamoDB record, and 
to print the programs in the output for each college.

TO HAND IN:
1.  A file README.txt that tells me how far you got, and what is working
2.  Two files:  upload.py  and query.py with your code
